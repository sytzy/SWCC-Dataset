This is the repository for the SWCCC Dataset. We provide some information of the dataset.

## Overview
SWCC is a benchmark dataset for agricultural object semantic segmentation, focusing on the Shawan region of Xinjiang, China. This dataset was collected by the Gaofen-1 satellite and fused 2-meter resolution panchromatic images with 8-meter resolution multispectral data, ultimately generating a 2-meter high-resolution multispectral image. SWCC covers five major crop categories: chili, winter wheat, corn, cotton, and tomato. All annotations are based on precise visual interpretation and field investigations, ensuring high quality and accuracy of the data.

### Dataset stats
The current version of the dataset includes:
1721 images (1377 for training and 344 for testing), containing 5 categories.
